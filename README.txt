# Assignment1-GU
We devided the tasks so that everyone had the main responsibility for two each;
Love had task 1 & task 2.
Emma had task 3 & task 4.
Martin had task 5 & task 6.
And with the rest we collaborated.
We worked both from home but also met up in school to be able to discuss issues and help eachother.
