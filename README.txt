# Assignment1-GU

We started off by discussing how we wanted the menu (Task 7) to function, and designed that class as a team.
Each person contributed with ideas on how we wanted it to look and function.

Then we divided the rest of the tasks so that everyone had even responsibility for two each;
- Love had task 1 & task 2.
- Emma had task 3 & task 4.
- Martin had task 5 & task 6.

The division of work fuctioned very well, but we did help each other out when it was needed by pair programming,
for example in Task 1 and Task 4 which took a bit more time and effort. 

Once all of the Tasks functioned correctly, Love implemented the IOSCanner class, whereafter we all helped out 
to find and change the code wherever we were using a regular Scanner before.

Task 9 was more or less done from the start, since we from the beginning chose to divide the code into functions
and classes. The classes were originaly named Task1, Task2, ... , and so on which Martin then changed into
"Students" and "Hashtags" and lumped methods which were logically connected into the same class, which meant
that the menu became logically separated from the rest.

Last of all, we tidied up the code, reduced code repetition and removed unnecessary parameters.

Most of the work was done in school where everybody participated, but we did communicate ideas and tried to
implement different soultions from home with GitHub branches. We then discussed those ideas once we met in school
and decided whether to keep those changes, revert them or do something else completely. 

-----------

For the re examination of this assignment, we changed the menu to a do while loop, we changed the looping for
entering the students scores in Students, we renamed methods to more descriptive names (verbs first) and fixed 
the IOSCanner so that it takes input directly.
